Please see: https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements/tree/st3atyourownrisk

# Description


Provides enhancements to the operations on Side Bar of Files and Folders for Sublime Text 2. See: http://www.sublimetext.com/

Notably provides delete as "move to trash", open with.. a and clipboard. Close, move, open and restore buffers affected by a rename/move command.

Provides the basics: new file/folder, edit, open/run, reveal, find in selected/parent/project, cut, copy, paste, paste in parent, rename, move, delete, refresh....

The not so basic: copy paths as URIs, URLs, content as UTF8, content as data:uri base64 ( nice for embedding into CSS! ), copy as tags img/a/script/style, duplicate


Preference to control if a buffer should be closed when affected by a deletion operation.

Allows to display "file modified date" and "file size" on statusbar.

All commands available for files and folders(when applicable) .

# F12 key

F12 key allows you to open the current file in browser.
If you want to add a url to that feature:

 * Right click any file on sidebar and select: "Project -> Edit Projects Preview URLs"
 * Edit this file, and add your paths and URLs with the following structure:

```
{
	"S:/www/domain.tld":{
		"url_testing":"http://testing",
		"url_production":"http://domain.tld"
	},
	"C:/Users/luna/some/domain2.tld":{
		"url_testing":"http://testing1",
		"url_production":"http://productiontld2"
	}
}
```

```url_testing``` allows you to set the url of your local server, opened via F12

```url_production``` allows you to set the url of your production server, opened via ALT+F12

# Notes on configuring the `Open With` menu:

Definitions file:  `User/SidebarEnhancements/Open With/Side Bar.sublime-menu` (note the extra subfolder levels).
To open it, right-click on any file in an open project and select `Open With > Edit Applications...`

- On OSX, the 'application' property simply takes the *name* of an application, to which the file at hand's full path will be passed as if with `open ...`, e.g.: "application": "Google Chrome"
- On OSX, invoking *shell* commands is NOT supported.

# Todo

 * Use a real clipboard integrated with the OS

# Installation

Install this repository via "Package Control" http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

# FAQ

Q: Uninstall?

 * Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements/issues/18

Q: Why the menu is not shown on `Open Files`?

- It should be mentioned that the package's context menu is only available for files and folders **in a project (section `Folders` in the side bar)**, and _not_ on the open files listed at the top of the side bar, due to a limitation of ST2.

# Using the External Libraries


 * "getImageInfo" to get width and height for images from "bfg-pages". See: http://code.google.com/p/bfg-pages/
 * "desktop" to be able to open files with system handlers. See: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/desktop
 * "send2trash" to be able to send to the trash instead of deleting for ever!. See: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Send2Trash
 * "hurry.filesize" to be able to format file sizes. See: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.filesize/
