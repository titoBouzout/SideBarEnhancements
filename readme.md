## Description

### [Sublime Text 3+][] Package, It does NOT WORK with ST2, DOES NOT; Use Sublime Text 3 Please.

Provides enhancements to the operations on Sidebar of Files and Folders for Sublime Text. <http://www.sublimetext.com/>

Notably provides delete as "move to trash", open with.. and a clipboard.

Close, move, open and restore buffers affected by a rename/move command. (even on folders)

Provides the basics: new file/folder, edit, open/run, reveal, find in selected/parent/project, cut, copy, paste, paste in parent, rename, move, delete, refresh....

The not so basic: copy paths as URIs, URLs, content as UTF8, content as <data:uri> base64 ( nice for embedding into CSS! ), copy as tags img/a/script/style, duplicate

Preference to control if a buffer should be closed when affected by a deletion operation.

Allows to display "file modified date" and "file size" on statusbar.

### Data collection

This code sends basic, anonymous statistics. We use this to understand the popularity
of different operating systems, builds of Sublime, Package Control plugin popularity,
and programming language popularity.  We use these statistics to target and prioritize
various features.  If you would like to opt out of these statistics, create a file in
your home directory called `.SideBarEnhancements.optout`.  You can do this by running
the following command:   touch ~/.SideBarEnhancements.optout


## Installation

Download or clone the contents of this repository to a folder named exactly as the package name into the Packages/ folder of ST.

Troubleshooting Installation:

If you have problems with the installation, do this:

-   First please note this package only adds a context menu to the "Folders" section and not to the "Open Files" section.
-   Open the package folder. Main menu -\> Preferences -\> Browse Packages.
-   Close Sublime Text.
-   Remove the folder "Packages/SideBarEnhancements"
-   Remove the folder "User/SideBarEnhancements"
-   Navigate one folder up, to "Installed Packages/", check for any instance of SideBarEnhancements and remove it.
-   Open ST, with Package Control go to : Remove Package, check for any instance of SideBarEnhancements and remove it.
-   Restart ST
-   Open ST, check if there is any entry about SideBarEnhancements in Package Control(in sections: "Remove Package" and just in case in "Enable Package")
-   Repeat until you find there no entry about SideBarEnhancements
-   Restart ST
-   Install it.
-   It works

## F12 key

(Please note that from version 2.122104 this package no longer provides the key, you need to manually add it to your sublime-keymap file (see next section))

F12 key allows you to open the current file in browser.

`url_testing` allows you to set the url of your local server, opened via F12

`url_production` allows you to set the url of your production server, opened via ALT+F12

### With absolute paths
-   Right click any file on sidebar and select: "Project -\> Edit Projects Preview URLs"
-   Edit this file, and add your paths and URLs with the following structure:

<!-- -->

    {
        "S:/www/domain.tld":{
            "url_testing":"http://testing",
            "url_production":"http://domain.tld"
        },
        "C:/Users/luna/some/domain2.tld":{
            "url_testing":"http://testing1",
            "url_production":"http://productiontld2"
        }
    }

### With relative paths

Imagine we have a project with the following structure

    Project/ < - root project folder
    Project/libs/
    Project/public/ < - the folder we want to load as "http://localhost/"
    Project/private/
    Project/experimental/ < - other folder we may run as experimental/test in another url "http://experimental/"

Then we create configuration file:

`Project/.sublime/SideBarEnhancements.json`

with content:

    {
        "public/":{
            "url_testing":"http://localhost/",
            "url_production":"http://domain.tld/"
        },
        "experimental/":{
            "url_testing":"http://experimental/",
            "url_production":"http://domain.tld/"
        },
        "":{
            "url_testing":"http://the_url_for_the_project_root/",
            "url_production":"http://the_url_for_the_project_root/"
        }
    }

...

You can create config files `some/folder/.sublime/SideBarEnhancements.json` anywhere.

#### F12 key conflict

On Sublime Text 3 `F12` key is bound to `"goto_definition"` command by default. This package was conflicting with that key, this no longers happens. You need to manually add the keys now: Go to `Preferences -> Package Settings -> Side Bar -> Key Bindings - User` and add any of the following:

        [
            { "keys": ["f12"],
                "command": "side_bar_open_in_browser" ,
                "args":{"paths":[], "type":"testing", "browser":""}
            },
            { "keys": ["alt+f12"],
                "command": "side_bar_open_in_browser",
                "args":{"paths":[], "type":"production", "browser":""}
            },
            {
                "keys": ["ctrl+t"],
                "command": "side_bar_new_file2"
            },
            {
                "keys": ["f2"],
                "command": "side_bar_rename"
            },
        ]

## Notes on configuring the `Open With` menu:

Definitions file: `User/SideBarEnhancements/Open With/Side Bar.sublime-menu` (note the extra subfolder levels). To open it, right-click on any file in an open project and select `Open With > Edit Applications...`

-   On OSX, the 'application' property simply takes the *name* of an application, to which the file at hand's full path will be passed as if with `open ...`, e.g.: "application": "Google Chrome"
-   On OSX, invoking *shell* commands is NOT supported.

<!-- -->

    //application 1
    {
        "caption": "Photoshop",
        "id": "side-bar-files-open-with-photoshop",
        "command": "side_bar_files_open_with",
        "args": {
            "paths": [],
            "application": "Adobe Photoshop CS5.app", // OSX
            "extensions":"psd|png|jpg|jpeg",  //any file with these extensions
            "args":[]
        }
        "open_automatically" : true // will close the view/tab and launch the application
    },

## FAQ

Q: Why the menu is not shown on `Open Files`?

-   It should be mentioned that the package's context menu is only available for files and folders **in a project (section** `Folders` **in the side bar)**, and *not* on the open files listed at the top of the side bar, due to a limitation of ST.

Q: Can the package stop "show preview in a **right** click to a file".

-   No, ​I'm sorry, can't figure out how to prevent it.

Q: Why are most of my options grayed out?  What do I do now?

- For Mac OSX, Open `Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Installed Packages` in finder and remove the file `SideBarEnhancements.sublime-package`
- For Windows, Open `AppData/Roaming/Sublime Text 3/Installed Packages` in explorer and remove the file `SideBarEnhancements.sublime-package`
- Both of these options work just fine and the file will be recreated
- After removing the files, Restart Sublime Text 3
